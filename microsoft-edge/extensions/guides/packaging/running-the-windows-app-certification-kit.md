# Running the Windows App Certification Kit  

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-note](../../includes/deprecation-note.md)]  

To improve the chances of your extension getting published to the Microsoft Store, you'll need to install and run the [Windows App Certification Kit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=309666).
This runs a [series of tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/windows-app-certification-kit-tests) on your extension package to ensure that it's ready for the Microsoft Store.

> [!NOTE]
> Submitting a Microsoft Edge extension to the Microsoft Store is currently a restricted capability. Once you've created, packaged and tested your extension, please submit a request on our [extension submission form](https://aka.ms/extension-request).

Before learning about how to use the kit, make sure you meet the following prerequisites: 

- You must install and run Windows 10.
- Sie müssen das [Zertifizierungskit für Windows-Apps, Version10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=309666) installieren, das im Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) für Windows10 enthalten ist.
- You must [enable your device for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development).
- You must have a [packaged](../packaging.md) extension.


If you meet the prerequisites, see the [Windows App Certification Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/windows-app-certification-kit#validate-your-windows-app-using-the-windows-app-certification-kit-interactively) documentation for info on how to use the Windows App Certification Kit either interactively or with the command line to test your extension.
