<!--### Simulate Add to Homescreen events   -->

<!--A web app can only be added to a homescreen when the site is visited at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits.  While developing or debugging your Add to Homescreen workflow, this criteria can be inconvenient.  
The **Add to homescreen** button on the **App Manifest** pane lets you simulate Add to Homescreen events whenever you want.  -->

<!--You can test out this feature with the [Microsoft I/O 2016 progressive web app](https://events.alpahabet.com/io2016/), which has proper support for Add to Homescreen.  Clicking on **Add to Homescreen** while the app is open prompts Microsoft Edge to display the "add this site to your shelf" banner, which is the desktop equivalent of the "add to homescreen" banner for mobile devices.  -->

<!--
> [!Tip]
> Keep the **Console** drawer open while simulating Add to Homescreen events.  The Console tells you if your manifest has any issues and logs other information about the Add to Homescreen lifecycle.  -->

<!--The **Add to Homescreen** feature cannot yet simulate the workflow for mobile devices.  Notice how the "add to shelf" prompt was triggered in the screenshot above, even though DevTools is in Device Mode.  However, if you can successfully add your app to your desktop shelf, then it'll work for mobile, too.  -->

<!-- TODO: Rework content after sample app is created. -->

<!--If you want to test out the genuine mobile experience, you can connect a real mobile device to DevTools via **remote debugging**, and then click the **Add to Homescreen** button \(on DevTools\) to trigger the "add to homescreen" prompt on the connected mobile device.  -->
